<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The US needs significant investment in electricity transmission lines in order to decarbonize the power sector. This paper examines the short- and long-run effects of large scale electricity grid expansion. I focus on the rollout of a grid expansion project that linked windy areas in west Texas to population centers in the east. Short-run analysis shows that: (1) Transmission expansion led to moderate declines in fossil fuel generator markups, about 2.5% during peak demand hours and 7% during off-peak hours. (2) It also prevented \$53 million (2020 \$) worth of annual damages from emissions. Long-run analysis finds evidence of higher wind capacity (+202%), more wind turbines (+245%), and bigger wind projects (+121%) in counties with transmission infrastructure. These results highlight that investments in grid level storage and upgrades can be useful in enhancing the value of estimated benefits.

Texas electricity market saw a recent integration of electricity transmission as a part of Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ). Exploiting the commissioning date of CREZ based transmission integration as an exogenous shock, we analyze the effect of transmission expansion on market clearing prices of Congestion Revenue Rights (CRR). Reduced form estimates suggest that excess transmission led to a lowering of CRR prices for contracts at all Times of Use. We find strong evidence of spatial, distributional, and firm specific heterogeneity. The paper shows that transmission expansion enhanced efficiency of the CRR market in terms of a spatial convergence in prices and a decrease in aggregate auction expenditure of approximately $260 million over a period of 4.5 years post CREZ.

Electricity Market Structure and Technology Adoption: Evidence from Renewable Energy <br/> with [Sarah Johnston](https://www.sarahbjohnston.com/) <br/>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper examines the effects of electricity market deregulation and long term contracting on technology adoption in the solar and wind industries in the US. Using data on all the solar and wind projects from 2001-2019, we estimate discrete choice models of technology adoption as a function of market structure and other characteristics. Results indicate that long term power purchase aggreements play a major role in technology adoption in the wind industry. The decision of solar projects to adopt tracking technology is a function of project size with smaller projects in deregulated markets less likely to adopt tracking. We do not find significant evidence that competition promotes technology adoption, but it may hinder adoption if it reduces the use of long-term contracts.

 An Equilibrium Analysis of Power Purchase Agreement <br/> with [Yeon Ju Baik](https://econ.wisc.edu/staff/baik-yeon-ju/) _(submitted)_ <br/>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are widely used long-term contracts to purchase electricity from renewable sources at a fixed price over long periods. This paper investigates the link between the risks associated with renewable power generation - specifically risks due to wholesale electricity price and project capacity. We examine a buyer's and seller's choice to participate in the PPA market using a stylized model. The equilibrium price is modeled as a function of wholesale market price and contracted quantity. Using the data on all utility-scale wind projects in the US, we test the predictions from the theoretical model in the empirical analysis of this paper. We show that the mean retail and wholesale electricity market price has a positive association with PPA prices whereas wholesale price volatility has a negative association with PPA prices. The sensitivity of the PPA prices are dependent on the participation decision of the buyers and sellers of electricity. Therefore, regulators should consider potential impacts of government policy on barriers to entry and length of contracts on PPA prices and therefore the financial returns of the renewable energy generators.

This chapter explores the reasons behind trade growth in goods and services over the years for some selected countries by using Novy’s measure. We calculate trade costs in terms of tariff equivalents by using the indirect trade cost measure given by Novy. Trade costs and trade growth accounting in both goods and services are shown separately. For trade costs in goods, we look at the case of India and APEC countries, and for trade costs in services we consider the 61 trading partners for which data is available.

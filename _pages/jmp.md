The US needs significant investment in electricity transmission lines in order to decarbonize the power sector. This paper examines the short- and long-run effects of large scale electricity grid expansion. I focus on the rollout of a grid expansion project that linked windy areas in west Texas to population centers in the east. Short-run analysis shows that: (1) Transmission expansion led to moderate declines in fossil fuel generator markups, about 2.5% during peak demand hours and 7% during off-peak hours. (2) It also prevented \$53 million (2020 \$) worth of annual damages from emissions. Long-run analysis finds evidence of higher wind capacity (+202%), more wind turbines (+245%), and bigger wind projects (+121%) in counties with transmission infrastructure. These results highlight that investments in grid level storage and upgrades can be useful in enhancing the value of estimated benefits.
